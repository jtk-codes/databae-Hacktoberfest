# Hacktoberfest contribution guidelines

I'm going to ask for contributions to be placed in `src/brainstorm`

I'm looking for HTML mockup pages for a blog site - which this will be - ideally incorporating the colors 
-#4701d0
-black 
-white 
And the font 
- lobster 

Although it won't run with the Vue dev server, you can put those files as html images with any css library dependencies under src/brainstorm with a .html extension, and I will take a look at them. Any that appear to be serious attempts will get a PR for hacktoberfest. 

If for any reason you feel like exploring a Vue project in the getting-started stage, you can actually run it with the steps below.
